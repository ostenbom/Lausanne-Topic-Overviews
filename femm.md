  While female workforce participation as a whole is improving on many fronts, many occupations and positions tend to be largely male or female dominated. What should the EU do to balance its current workforce and inspire young Europeans to take up non traditional occupations?

## Explanation of the Problem & Relevance of the Topic

While women’s employment is constantly growing, a gender-segregated labour market is still the reality in the European Union (EU). There exists both, horizontal and vertical segregation. While women are overrepresented in care-related fields such as health, education and the service sector, men dominate sectors such as {% tooltip  Overview to gender equality in the labour market <a href='http://ec.europa.eu/justice/events/future-of-gender-equality-2015/files/gender_equality_labour_market_en.pdf'>http://ec.europa.eu/justice/events/future-of-gender-equality-2015/files/gender_equality_labour_market_en.pdf</a>
 %} construction, transport, industry and agriculture {% endtooltip %}. Furthermore, men are {% tooltip  Article: It’s time to break the glass ceiling for Europe’s women <a href='http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/nov/19/time-break-glass-ceiling-women-europe'>http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/nov/19/time-break-glass-ceiling-women-europe</a>
 %} more likely to work in higher tier jobs than women {% endtooltip %}. As a result of unequal sharing of household duties, it is often women that feel the necessity for a job where they can combine work and family responsibilities.  

Childcare support is not sufficient in many Member States, so that women often work in part-time jobs or sacrifice their career for their children.

In education, gender inequalities exist in terms of {% tooltip  Gender differences and stereotypes in education <a href='http://eacea.ec.europa.eu/education/eurydice./documents/thematic_reports/120EN_HI.pdf'>http://eacea.ec.europa.eu/education/eurydice./documents/thematic_reports/120EN_HI.pdf</a>
 %} study subject preferences, performance and patterns of participation{% endtooltip %}. Gender stereotypes influence young people in their study and career choices and at the same time keep employers from hiring women for certain positions.

Generally, the segregation in the labour market implies an underutilisation of female/male talent and has immense impact on women’s {% tooltip  European Commission (2011). Background note ‘Responding to unequal pay’ Retrieved from <a href='http://ec.europa.eu/justice/gender-equality/files/conference_sept_2011/background-paperii-gender-pay-gap_en.pdf'>http://ec.europa.eu/justice/gender-equality/files/conference_sept_2011/background-paperii-gender-pay-gap_en.pdf</a>
 %} pay, pensions and lifelong earnings, increasing their risk of poverty{% endtooltip %}. Moreover, it facilitates low wages for women’s work. As it is more acceptable to have variations in wages due to different occupations or contracts than in pay for workers in the same workplace, the existing gender pay gap is even bigger.

What can the EU do to achieve a more equal distribution of family responsibilities?

How can Member States support its citizens for a better compatibility of work and family?

How can be ensured that hiring decisions in companies aren’t influenced by gender stereotypes and that boys and girls are equally inspired to take opportunities according to their skills?

In December 2013, the EU established {% tooltip  Overview to Rights, Equality and Citizenship Programme 2014-2020 <a href='http://ec.europa.eu/justice/grants1/programmes-2014-2020/rec/index_en.htm'>http://ec.europa.eu/justice/grants1/programmes-2014-2020/rec/index_en.htm</a>

The different **Member States** have taken various measures to tackle the issue, yet there is no consensus among Member States which is the most effective approach. Some Member States such as Belgium, Italy and the Netherlands have imposed **gender quotas** for boards, requiring companies to have a certain percentage of women in senior positions. Furthermore, several Member States launched initiatives like a girls day/boys day, encouraging youngsters to get to know jobs that are non-traditional for their gender.

## Key Terms & Key Actors

**Gender-segregated labour market:** The labour market is divided into female and male dominated fields.

**Vertical dimension:** Opportunities for career progression for a particular gender are narrowed. It is still widespread in all sectors.

**Horizontal dimension:** Specific industries or sectors are mostly made up of one gender.

{% tooltip Video and Overview: What are the causes? <a href='http://ec.europa.eu/justice/gender-equality/gender-pay-gap/causes/index_en.htm' >http://ec.europa.eu/justice/gender-equality/gender-pay-gap/causes/index_en.htm</a> %}**Gender pay gap:** Calculated over a lifetime, as well as per hour, women earn less than men. {% endtooltip %}

**Gender stereotypes:** Gender stereotypes are generalisations about the roles of each gender. They still exist in our society and often unconsciously influence our way of thinking and decision making.

**Gender quota:** Gender quotas aim to recruit women in certain positions, setting a minimum percentage of women that need to be hired/elected.

**Member States:** The sovereign Member States play a key role in the issue, especially as it is their responsibility to deal with education and employment.

**European Union:** As one of its core values, the EU aims to achieve gender equality and a balanced labour market. As the sole legislative power of the EU, the European Commission can draft and adopt legislation in collaboration with the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union. Concerning women’s rights and gender inequality, the EU holds shared and supporting competences with the Members States. All legislation drafted either needs to be established alongside Member States, or established by Member States themselves.

Companies: By making hiring decision, companies crucially shape the labour market.
