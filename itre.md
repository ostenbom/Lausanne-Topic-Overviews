  The 2015 Paris Agreement on climate change set the goal of "holding the increase in the global average temperature to well below two Degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels". What role, if any, should nuclear power play in reaching this goal and ensuring a sustainable and reliable energy supply for Europe?

## Explanation of the Problem & Relevance of the Topic

After several failed attempts to make a global climate agreement over past years, {% tooltip Read more about COP21 here: <br> <a href='http://www.cop21.gouv.fr/en/' >http://www.cop21.gouv.fr/en/</a><br><a href='http://ec.europa.eu/clima/policies/international/negotiations/paris/index_en.htm' >http://ec.europa.eu/clima/policies/international/negotiations/paris/index_en.htm</a> %} the COP21 {% endtooltip %} (Conference of Parties) meeting in Paris last year succeeded in reaching a universal agreement to restrict the increase in global average temperature.  The conference was planned carefully beforehand, and participating countries indicated a whole new kind of motivation to slow down global warming, which made the agreement possible.

This agreement was warmly welcomed and celebrated, but many issues are still to be solved. 195 countries are committed to the climate agreement, but no universal nor national means of executing the agreement were settled. It is now up to every nation themselves to work on the common goals of reducing carbon emissions. The problem is that the world is still reliant on fossil fuels; renewable energy sources, such as wind, water and solar power are being developed, but they are not yet developed to the point where they can replace fossil fuels.

This is where the question of {% tooltip Nuclear Energy Basics <a href='http://www.world-nuclear.org/nuclear-basics.aspx' >http://www.world-nuclear.org/nuclear-basics.aspx</a>  %} nuclear energy {% endtooltip %} arises. Nuclear energy causes no carbon emissions, and is highly developed. Many researches have said that it is the {% tooltip  <a href='http://www.independent.co.uk/environment/cop21-world-must-embrace-nuclear-power-to-save-planet-from-climate-change-claim-leading-scientists-a6759236.html' >http://www.independent.co.uk/environment/cop21-world-must-embrace-nuclear-power-to-save-planet-from-climate-change-claim-leading-scientists-a6759236.html</a>  %} only way we can cut our carbon emissions enough{% endtooltip %}. However, nuclear energy is also associated with many doubts and risks. The accident in Fukushima in 2011 raised concerns about the safety of nuclear energy, and also the radioactive waste and problems with its final placement are reasons why many object nuclear energy.

## Key Conflicts

Nuclear energy is produced in 14 Member States and it counts for around 30 % of EU’s electricity supply. It becomes even more important when the EU is trying to cut its dependence on fossil fuels. Nuclear energy is widely researched and highly developed, and in Europe it has been proven to be safe: after the nuclear accident in Fukushima, Japan in 2011, stress tests were carried out in the EU on nuclear installations with good results.

Probably the most appealing argument in favour of nuclear energy is that is does not cause any emissions. It is also cost-effective: once a nuclear installations is built, it serves with low costs for a long time. Nuclear energy can also improve the EU and its Member States’ energy independence, since its usage reduces the need to import fossil fuels from abroad.

Despite its good qualities, nuclear energy is also widely opposed. Even though the nuclear installations in the EU are secure, many are concerned about the safety of nuclear energy. Even though using nuclear energy is every nation’s own decision, the threats it causes concerns people in neighbouring countries as well. Some people also fear that the spread of nuclear energy could lead to proliferation of nuclear weapons, although this is not a serious threat in the EU.

A major concern about nuclear energy is the waste it causes. Some techniques of reusing the nuclear fuel are being developed, but in the end the radioactive fuel is only stored in a deep geological repository and the waste will remain radioactive for thousands of years. Another argument against nuclear energy are the political issues around it: uranium used for nuclear energy has to be imported, which increases the EU’s energy dependence. Russia is connected to many nuclear energy companies and projects in the EU, which makes the EU even more dependent on Russia concerning its energy supply. In addition the Member States’ differing legislation concerning nuclear power is a problem.

* In 2013 nuclear energy counted for 28% of all energy supply in the EU

-    14 EU Member States have nuclear installations, France being the biggest nuclear energy producer. Germany will shut down its nuclear installations by 2022

-    The average age of nuclear reactors in the EU is around 29 years

-    The nuclear industry in the EU directly employs 400 000-500 000 people

-    A large amount of the EU’s existing nuclear energy production capacity has to be replaced by 2050, this will cost around 350-500 billion €

-    Used nuclear fuel has to be isolated for around 100 000 years

-    In 2014 the share of renewable energy in the EU was around 15%, the target by 2030 being 27%

Energy, including nuclear power, belongs to EU’s and Member States’ shared competences; neither one has an overpowering competence concerning the matter, but both can influence the legislation. Even though each country is responsible for its own stance on nuclear power, the EU has also common policies regulating nuclear energy:

-    The use of nuclear energy within the EU is governed by the 1957 Euratom Treaty.

-    In 2014, the EU amended its Nuclear Safety Directive from 2009, which sets up common safety rules for nuclear installations.

-    The EU's Directive for the Management of Radioactive Waste and Spent Fuel sets rules for safely disposing of used radioactive materials.

-    The EU has radiation protection legislation; it for example requires Member States to monitor radioactivity.

-    The EU’s nuclear safeguards ensure that nuclear materials are not misused.

-    The Euratom Supply Agency (ESA) ensures a regular and diversified supply of nuclear fuels to EU.

Each EU country decides alone whether to include nuclear power in its energy mix or not. {% tooltip Article on Germany's renewables:<br> <a href='http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2015/11/climate-change/germany-renewable-energy-revolution-text' >http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2015/11/climate-change/germany-renewable-energy-revolution-text</a>
 %} For example Germany {% endtooltip %} decided to shut down all of its nuclear reactors by 2022 after the accident in Fukushima, but new nuclear power plants are being planned and built for example in France and Finland.

In 2015 the Commission adopted {% tooltip More about the strategy here:<br> <a href='http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_MEMO-15-6106_en.htm' >http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_MEMO-15-6106_en.htm</a> %} Energy Union Framework Strategy {% endtooltip %}: the goal of the energy union is to ensure low-carbon, secure and competitive energy supply in the EU, which would mean cutting the consumption of fossil fuels and therefore carbon emissions. The union has a {% tooltip  <a href='https://ec.europa.eu/energy/en/topics/renewable-energy' >https://ec.europa.eu/energy/en/topics/renewable-energy</a> %} new renewable energy {% endtooltip %} target of at least 27% of all energy consumption by 2030. This target is part of the EU's energy and climate goals for 2030.
