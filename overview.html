  <h4>Dear Participants,</h4>

  <p>
    Contained in this website is the academic preparation kit for RS Lausanne 2016. Before arriving at the session, it is vital that you prepare yourself. Coming up with a solution to a problem you know nothing about is fairly difficult, so we have put together this academic preparation kit for you which outlines both the topics at the session and the EU as a whole. You should at the very least read your own topic overview - but the preparation does not end there. Included in all the overviews are links for further research - these are a good starting point to widen your view on the topic. The more effort you put into preparing yourself, the more you can contribute to your committee and its resolution at the session.

  <h4>Happy reading!</h4>
