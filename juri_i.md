  A recently launched popular initiative demands that obligations of international law should only be subordinate to the Swiss constitution and Swiss domestic law. Bearing in mind the impact this may have on the authority of the European Court of Human Rights, should every European country be free to decide on the relation between its domestic and international law?

## Explanation of the problem / Relevance of the topic

Due to globalization, countries interact and depend on each other more and more. As a result, many international treaties are agreed upon and expanded. International law no longer just describes relations between different states, but is rather **aimed at citizens** - e.g. by regulating human rights.

Every country also has its own domestic legislation, where they define the rights and duties of their citizens, this means that there is inevitably some overlap between domestic and international laws. This **overlap** brings up issues such as: Is further harmonisation needed between international and national law? How extensive should national sovereignty be in a globalised world? Should international law have supremacy over domestic law? The {% tooltip The self-determination initiative «Swiss law instead of foreign judges» is a popular initiative by the right-wing populist party Swiss People’s Party (SVP), that aims to end the priority that is given to international law and attacks the European Convention on Human Rights.

## **Key conflicts**

If not properly harmonised, conflict can occur between **norms of domestic law and international law**. The question is then which one of the two takes precedence . Only very few state constitutions {% tooltip In the following article, both countries that accept this supremacy as countries that don’t are discussed: Peters, A. (2009).

In some member states, namely Austria and Italy, the ECHR is accorded the same domestic status as constitutional law, although this is probably not uncontroversial everywhere. In the Netherlands and in Belgium, the Convention has a supra-constitutional status. (Source:  Peters, A. (2009). Supremacy Lost: International Law Meets Domestic Constitutional Law. Vienna Journal on International Constitutional Law 2009 (vol. 3), 192.) %} rejected by numerous constitutional actors.{% endtooltip %} One could argue that clashes between international human rights law and domestic law are not very likely to occur, since domestic constitutions generally include these human rights too. Yet, even if there is no outright clash between the two, a divergence concerning the scope or interpretation of the right can for example arise and have a profound impact on the application of that particular human right.

In general, scholars discuss the relation between international law and domestic law with reference to two different theories: {% tooltip For more information about these two theories, see: Kaufmann, C. & Chan, J.

Dualists on the other hand look upon domestic and international law as two different, independent legal orders. As a result, international law first has to get incorporated into national law, before it can be applied  by national courts. England is an example of the dualist model of international law, {% tooltip To find out more about the situation in Switzerland, see: Kaufmann, C. & Chan, J. (2008).

In case a state violates its international obligations as stipulated in international law, the question arises what **right** the international community has **to intervene**. {% tooltip Article 41: *'The Security Council may decide what measures not involving the use of armed force are to be employed to give effect to its decisions, and it may call upon the Members of the United Nations to apply such measures. These may include complete or partial interruption of economic relations and of rail, sea, air, postal, telegraphic, radio, and other means of communication, and the severance of diplomatic relations.'* <br> Article 42: *'Should the Security Council consider that measures provided for in Article 41 would be inadequate or have proved to be inadequate, it may take such action by air, sea, or land forces as may be necessary to maintain or restore international peace and security. Such action may include demonstrations, blockade, and other operations by air, sea, or land forces of Members of the United Nations.'* %}Articles 41 and 42 of the United Nations (UN) Charter {% endtooltip %} define which actions the UN Security Council can take in case of threats to the peace, breaches of the peace and acts of aggression, including the use of force. Individual states cannot use force to intervene {% tooltip This right of self-defence is stipulated in Article 51 of the United Nations Charter: '*Nothing in the present Charter shall impair the inherent right of individual or collective self-defence if an armed attack occurs against a Member of the United Nations, until the Security Council has taken measures necessary to maintain international peace and security. Measures taken by Members in the exercise of this right of self-defence shall be immediately reported to the Security Council and shall not in any way affect the authority and responsibility of the Security Council under the present Charter to take at any time such action as it deems necessary in order to maintain or restore international peace and security.'* %} except where such force is necessary in self-defence {% endtooltip %}. Other than that, there is no clear legal framework for the intervention of states, nor the international community, in case a party breaches international law, even though there is the general principle of {% tooltip Customary international law is international law that is not written down, though generally accepted by the international community. %}customary international law {% endtooltip %} {% tooltip This principle means that treaties are to be respected by the contracting parties and is translated in Article 26 of the Vienna Convention on the law of treaties (*'Every treaty in force is binding upon the parties to it and must be performed by them in good faith.'*) %}‘pacta sunt servanda’.{% endtooltip %}

Even if a state formally recognises the supremacy of international law over domestic law, this supremacy is only real if a national court has the ability to apply the international law and review domestic law for its compatibility with international law. There is thus a distinction between **theory and reality**, which do not always convene. A fine example is the case of France, where international law was largely ignored by national courts until the 1980s, even though the French Constitution grants priority to international treaties over national statutes (Article 55). When the individual complaint mechanism of the ECHR was accepted in 1981, the risk occurred of the judgement of an international court being issued against France and consequently, French courts began to frequently apply the Convention.
