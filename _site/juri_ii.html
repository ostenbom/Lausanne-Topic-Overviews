<p>Euronews report on corruption in the EU- with many examples! September 2012</p>

<h2 id="key-conflicts">Key Conflicts</h2>

<p>It is a fact that where there is money, there is always the suspicion of corruption. Yet how much does that extend to <strong>political financing</strong>? In order for a party to garner funds to run a campaign for elections, or pay for its staff usually depends on 3 sources: government funding, member funding and of course sponsoring by private firms and individuals. So on one hand we have political parties who may use that funding for advocating people’s’ rights but on the other simply direct it to satisfying only their private funders. This only increases scepticism on just how much a party works in the interest of people in general or wealthy firms and individuals. A common discomfort among voters is to consider how much a political party would discuss regulating its own revenues. Can the example of the <a href="#" onclick="return false;" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" data-content="COM(2014) 38 of 3.2.2014, Report from the Commision to the Council and the European Parliament, “EU Anti Corruption Report”, Page 10, Retrieved from:   &lt;a href='http://ec.europa.eu/dgs/home-affairs/e-library/documents/policies/organized-crime-and-human-trafficking/corruption/docs/acr_2014_en.pdf'&gt;http://ec.europa.eu/dgs/home-affairs/e-library/documents/policies/organized-crime-and-human-trafficking/corruption/docs/acr_2014_en.pdf&lt;/a&gt;  "> Finnish political financing regulation </a> be one to follow? Another issue is <strong>how far the law can extend its arm</strong>. Corruption can be of any kind, starting from bribing a police officer about a parking ticket, to taking out a politician for dinner in exchange for a favour, to offering a multi-million euro cheque in order to prevent the passing of a law. How easy is it to convince people to neither take or offer bribes when they are the easiest solution, especially in times where there are economic difficulties? On one hand we usually have people who are frustrated with the need to use your own connections in order to avoid penalties and get things done, and on the other hand we have individuals who are well suited in a corrupt society as they have strong friends in power who can help them out in any way.  Another important issue is <strong>how regulated lobbying can really be</strong>. Advocating the interests of an industry, an organisation or even a group of people does not seem that wrong in essence, but when does it become too much? Lobbying can be of any kind starting from a simple powerpoint presentation on what the issue at hand is to money guarantees regarding election campaigns. Can we really know what is legal or not? Transparency International has been calling for years that lobbying should be further regulated in order to make sure that all parties have an equal opportunity to influence members of political institutions. On the other hand though, large companies find it very fair since they can funnel as many promises as they want to politicians through a lobbyist without necessarily being there.</p>
