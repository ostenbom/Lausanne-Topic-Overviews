<p>With global temperatures rising well over 1°C on average, the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP21) Paris agreement aimed to avoid this <a href="#" onclick="return false;" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" data-content="COP21 Paris Agreement Elements: &lt;a href='http://ec.europa.eu/clima/policies/international/negotiations/paris/index_en.htm'&gt;http://ec.europa.eu/clima/policies/international/negotiations/paris/index_en.htm&lt;/a&gt; "> dangerous change and to limit global warming to well below 2°C. </a> The tourism industry contributes to a significant part of the GHG emissions that directly influence this change.</p>

<p>Tourism plays a huge role in the world economy. It was estimated in 2013, travel and tourism represents approximately 5% of total EU Gross Domestic Product (GDP), or 586 billion Euros. The industry creates approximately 12% of the world’s jobs (direct and indirect) and is the <a href="#" onclick="return false;" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" data-content="Sustainable Tourism within the EU Tourism policy: &lt;a href='http://cor.europa.eu/en/activities/arlem/activities/meetings/Documents/cristina-calabro-stineutourism-policy.pdf'&gt;http://cor.europa.eu/en/activities/arlem/activities/meetings/Documents/cristina-calabro-stineutourism-policy.pdf&lt;/a&gt;  "> 3rd largest economic activity in the EU </a></p>

<p>On the other hand, however, the tourism industry is extremely unsustainable. The average person in the UK uses approximately 150 litres of water per day, a luxury hotel room guest can use up to 1800 litres. <a href="#" onclick="return false;" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" data-content="Global Hospitality Insights, page 16: &lt;a href='http://www.ey.com/Publication/vwLUAssets/ey-global-hospitality-insights-2015/$File/ey-global-hospitality-insights-2015.pdf'&gt;http://www.ey.com/Publication/vwLUAssets/ey-global-hospitality-insights-2015/$File/ey-global-hospitality-insights-2015.pdf&lt;/a&gt; "> The demand for luxury hotels is growing </a> while merely <a href="#" onclick="return false;" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" data-content="Sustainable water management: &lt;a href='http://pacinst.org/issues/sustainable-water-management-local-to-global/'&gt;http://pacinst.org/issues/sustainable-water-management-local-to-global/&lt;/a&gt; "> 3% of the world’s water is potable and 780 million people still lack access to clean water </a>. Other than that, the amount of cars on the road surpassed 1 billion in 2010, in 2015 this number had increased to 1.2 billion, this roughly translates to 90 million tons of carbon dioxide into our atmosphere.

The EU, in alliance with the tourism industry, is a key player in the effort to achieving a more sustainable tourism industry. Here, the key question is how to effectively regulate tourism with its massive environmental impact with a minimal effect the sizable revenue it brings.</p>

<h2 id="key-conflicts">Key Conflicts</h2>

<p>There are several main conflicts at play here in this issue, with the first and foremost relating to <strong>transport infrastructures</strong>. To make the tourism industry more sustainable, a solution to the massive amount of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions caused by private cars and planes must first be found. The EU has set ambitious targets and some progress has already been made towards a single European Transport area through initiatives such as the <a href="#" onclick="return false;" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" data-content="Infrastructure - TEN-T - Connecting Europe: &lt;a href='http://ec.europa.eu/transport/themes/infrastructure/index_en.htm'&gt;http://ec.europa.eu/transport/themes/infrastructure/index_en.htm&lt;/a&gt; "> Trans-European Transport Network (TEN-T) and Transport 2050. </a> But since the EU only has shared competence in this issue, meaning Member States may create their own transportation policy, this leads to divergencies in the implementation of these policies and meeting the targets. Member States are currently renewing their infrastructure in order to incorporate European Initiatives, this leads people to change their conventional mode of transport due to <strong>financial arrangements</strong>, such as cheaper public transport tickets in comparison to gasoline, getting reductions for family outings using public transports or creating <strong>better accessibility</strong> to public transports. However, transport infrastructure and related research investments across Member States vary greatly, which hinders the TEN-T program goals. How can the EU circumnavigate these issues and create and maintain an accessible and versatile pan-European transport network?</p>

<p>The second hurdle the EU has to overcome to achieve sustainable tourism is <strong>creating incentives</strong> for travellers whose unsustainable way of travelling is still deeply engraved in their mindset. People on holidays don’t tend to think about <strong>recycling</strong>, <strong>energy and water conservation</strong> or the merchandise they purchase, even though there are many <a href="#" onclick="return false;" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" data-content="Travel Tips - Carbon Conscious Tips: &lt;a href='http://www.sustainabletourism.net/sustainable-tourism/travel-tips/'&gt;http://www.sustainabletourism.net/sustainable-tourism/travel-tips/&lt;/a&gt; "> small things they can do to make their travels more eco-friendly </a>, such as renting a hybrid or electric car instead of using a private one which burns fossil fuel, wear more clothes instead of turning up the thermostat to conserve energy, etc. The problem is simply that people are often too lazy to care. How should The EU better promote these ideas to its citizens on an European level to achieve a more eco-friendly travelling mindset?</p>

<p>The third and last conflict in this issue is that of <strong>sustainability vs. competitiveness</strong>. By increasing the effort to achieve sustainability, eg. setting up recycling structures, paying carbon taxes for flights and reducing the seasonality of demand, tourism companies will have a loss of profit and will thus be unwilling to comply. If tourism companies increase their prices to keep up with their profit, their competitiveness will be severely harmed, this will make people less likely to travel to a particular country and thus indirectly, negatively impact countries whose main economic income is tourism, such as Greece. How can the EU work with major tourism companies to follow through the sustainability targets?</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The total contribution of Travel &amp; Tourism to GDP was USD 2’136 billion (<strong>9.2% of GDP</strong>) in 2014, forecasted to <strong>rise by 2.4%</strong> in 2015 and rise by 2.6% to USD 2’833 billion (9.8% of GDP) in 2025.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Visitor exports</strong> generated USD 568 billion (<strong>5.6% of total exports</strong>) in 2014. This is forecasted to grow by 3.4% in 2015, and <strong>grow by 3.8%</strong> to USD 851.5 billion in 2025.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Travel &amp; Tourism investment in 2014 was USD 215.1 billion (4.7% of total investment). This should rise by 2.4% in 2015, and 3.2% over the next ten years to USD 301.7 billion in 2025.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="measures-in-place">Measures in Place</h2>

<p>Since 2010, the EU has put in place <strong>a system of indicators</strong> for a sustainable management of tourist destinations. The <strong>European Charter for a Sustainable and Responsible tourism</strong>, has the aim of streamlining existing charter initiatives into one single document, and the <a href="#" onclick="return false;" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" data-content="European Charter for Sustainable and Responsible Tourism: &lt;a href='http://www.ceeweb.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Commented_Tourism_Charter_CEEweb.pdf'&gt;http://www.ceeweb.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Commented_Tourism_Charter_CEEweb.pdf&lt;/a&gt; "> principles of sustainable tourism have been agreed upon. </a> Also, the <a href="#" onclick="return false;" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" data-content="EDEN European Destinations of Excellence: &lt;a href='http://ec.europa.eu/growth/tools-databases/eden/'&gt;http://ec.europa.eu/growth/tools-databases/eden/&lt;/a&gt; "> <strong>European Destination of Excellence (EDEN) initiative</strong> </a> also helps to draw attention to the values, diversity and common features of European tourist destinations. This is achieved by selecting a tourist “destination of excellence” for each participating country every other year based on the criteria of service quality and sustainability.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, in the transport sector, the <strong>European Commission on Travel</strong> (ETC) adopted the <a href="#" onclick="return false;" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" data-content="Transport 2050: Commission outlines ambitious plan to increase mobility and reduce emissions: &lt;a href='http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-11-372_en.htm'&gt;http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-11-372_en.htm&lt;/a&gt; "> <strong>Transport 2050</strong> </a> strategy, a comprehensive strategy that aims to achieve a single European transport network to increase mobility. Key goals include (a) shifting 50% of all <strong>medium-distance</strong> passenger and freight transport <strong>from the roads to rail and waterborne</strong> transport and (b) increasing the efficiency of new engines, fuels and traffic management systems of <strong>long-distance travel</strong> and <strong>intercontinental</strong> air travel and ships <a href="#" onclick="return false;" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" data-content="Roadmap to a single European transport area (page 9): &lt;a href='http://ec.europa.eu/transport/themes/strategies/doc/2011_white_paper/white-paper-illustrated-brochure_en.pdf'&gt;http://ec.europa.eu/transport/themes/strategies/doc/2011_white_paper/white-paper-illustrated-brochure_en.pdf&lt;/a&gt; "> among many others </a>. To achieve these goals, a list of initiatives were proposed including:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Open the domestic rail passengers market to competition, meaning all rail companies should no longer be state monopolised, but rather adopt the open market system.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Completion of the Single European Sky. Create and deploy an air traffic tracking system (SESAR) for all airlines within Europe as well as establish the appropriate legal and financial framework for this to happen.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Harmonise and deploy road safety equipments such as driver assistance systems, speed limiters, seat belt reminders, eCall, cooperative systems and vehicle-infrastructure interfaces — as well as improved roadworthiness tests.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>For the full list of initiatives proposed, please consult the link in footnote 14 on pages 19-28.</p>

<p>In addition, there is the <strong>Trans-European Transport Network</strong>(TET-N), a new transportation infrastructure policy proposed by the European Union to connect all corners of Europe while making the best use of all the different means of travel. It promotes and strengthens <strong>seamless transport chains</strong> for passenger and freight, while keeping up with the latest technological trends. This project will help the economy, with a budget of <strong>€24.05 billion</strong> up to 2020.</p>

<p>There are also a variety of projects launched by various non-governmental organisations  with the aim to further reduce CO2-emission by travelling. An example is the <strong>EuroVelo</strong> project, aimed to develop a network of high-quality cycling routes, which can be used by long-distance cycle tourists as well as locals.</p>

<p>Last but not least, there are also other initiatives such as <a href="#" onclick="return false;" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" data-content="Calypso: Tourism for all: &lt;a href='http://ec.europa.eu/growth/sectors/tourism/offer/calypso/index_en.htm'&gt;http://ec.europa.eu/growth/sectors/tourism/offer/calypso/index_en.htm&lt;/a&gt; "> <strong>Calypso</strong> </a>, which aims to combat high seasonality in certain regions. Calypso works by promoting <strong>transnational exchanges</strong> between different countries or regions during low-tourist seasons. The initiative has been running since 2009. The initiative:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>promotes off-season tourism</strong>, particularly in regions where tourism is well developed, but highly seasonal;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>gives lesser-known, smaller, or emerging destinations the opportunity to <strong>promote themselves</strong> to a broader range of European tourists;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>encourages longer-lasting employment</strong> in the tourism industry by making it possible to extend jobs beyond the peak season.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="key-terms--actors">Key Terms &amp; Actors</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The <strong>European Commission:</strong> executive branch of the EU, sets central environmental targets, launches initiatives on a European level and strategises the means needed to reach the set goals. The European Commission however does <strong>not</strong> have exclusive competence in the area of travel and tourism, but <a href="#" onclick="return false;" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" data-content="Supportive competence means no directives, regulations or decisions can be made by the EU, but recommendations are always possible. "> rather a supportive </a> one.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Member States:</strong> responsible for implementing the targets and policies set by the EU and transpose its legislation into national law. Due to the supportive competence in the tourism sector, the Member States play the biggest role since for anything to be implemented, it is solely up to each individual Member States.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>European Travel Commission</strong>(ETC): Commission within the European Commission specifically responsible for issues on travel and transportation.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference</strong> (COP21) Paris Agreement: An agreement that is the first-ever universal, legally binding global climate deal signed between 195 countries. Due to enter into force in 2020.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Small and Medium Enterprises</strong> (SMEs): Makes up the majority of the tourism industry, working under the legislative framework provided by the EU and Member States. SMEs invest in research to expand and optimise their effectiveness, profitability and efficiency, as well as ideally maximise its benefits to civil society and the environment.</p>
