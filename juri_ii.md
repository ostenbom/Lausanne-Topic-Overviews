  From straight out bribing to arrangements with high profiled public officials: After recent scandals of high level corruption in both private and public sector, which steps should the EU and its Member States take towards more transparency and accountability?

## Explanation of the Problem & Relevance of the Topic

Corruption is defined by the **Transparency International** as {% tooltip  Transparency International Definition of Corruption, Retrieved from: <a href='http://www.transparency.org/what-is-corruption/#define'>http://www.transparency.org/what-is-corruption/#define</a>  %} "the abuse of entrusted power for private gain" {% endtooltip %}. Essentially it is one of the greatest crimes of our times and has riddled many countries across the European Union (EU). During the past years, more and more scandals have been reaching the surface -especially during the global financial crisis- both within Member States and in European institutions themselves. Recent examples have been the {% tooltip EurActiv.com, “Journalistic spoof traps MEPs in bribery affair”, (March 29, 2011), Retrieved from: <a href='http://www.euractiv.com/section/public-affairs/news/journalistic-spoof-traps-meps-in-bribery-affair/'>http://www.euractiv.com/section/public-affairs/news/journalistic-spoof-traps-meps-in-bribery-affair/</a>  %} Cash for Amendments scandal {% endtooltip %} where 3 Members of the **European Parliament** (MEPs) have been convicted to jail time in their own respective countries for taking bribes, or the {% tooltip EurActiv.com with Reuters, “EU health commissioner resigns over anti-fraud case”, (October 23, 2012), Retrieved from: <a href='https://www.euractiv.com/section/health-consumers/news/eu-health-commissioner-resigns-over-anti-fraud-case/'>https://www.euractiv.com/section/health-consumers/news/eu-health-commissioner-resigns-over-anti-fraud-case/</a>  %} scandal regarding Health Commissioner Dalli {% endtooltip %} where a tobacco company tried to bribe the Commissioner through an acquaintance of his.

## Key Conflicts

It is a fact that where there is money, there is always the suspicion of corruption. Yet how much does that extend to **political financing**? In order for a party to garner funds to run a campaign for elections, or pay for its staff usually depends on 3 sources: government funding, member funding and of course sponsoring by private firms and individuals. So on one hand we have political parties who may use that funding for advocating people's’ rights but on the other simply direct it to satisfying only their private funders. This only increases scepticism on just how much a party works in the interest of people in general or wealthy firms and individuals. A common discomfort among voters is to consider how much a political party would discuss regulating its own revenues. Can the example of the {% tooltip COM(2014) 38 of 3.2.2014, Report from the Commision to the Council and the European Parliament, “EU Anti Corruption Report”, Page 10, Retrieved from:   <a href='http://ec.europa.eu/dgs/home-affairs/e-library/documents/policies/organized-crime-and-human-trafficking/corruption/docs/acr_2014_en.pdf'>http://ec.europa.eu/dgs/home-affairs/e-library/documents/policies/organized-crime-and-human-trafficking/corruption/docs/acr_2014_en.pdf</a>  %} Finnish political financing regulation {% endtooltip %} be one to follow? Another issue is **how far the law can extend its arm**. Corruption can be of any kind, starting from bribing a police officer about a parking ticket, to taking out a politician for dinner in exchange for a favour, to offering a multi-million euro cheque in order to prevent the passing of a law. How easy is it to convince people to neither take or offer bribes when they are the easiest solution, especially in times where there are economic difficulties? On one hand we usually have people who are frustrated with the need to use your own connections in order to avoid penalties and get things done, and on the other hand we have individuals who are well suited in a corrupt society as they have strong friends in power who can help them out in any way.  Another important issue is **how regulated lobbying can really be**. Advocating the interests of an industry, an organisation or even a group of people does not seem that wrong in essence, but when does it become too much? Lobbying can be of any kind starting from a simple powerpoint presentation on what the issue at hand is to money guarantees regarding election campaigns. Can we really know what is legal or not? Transparency International has been calling for years that lobbying should be further regulated in order to make sure that all parties have an equal opportunity to influence members of political institutions. On the other hand though, large companies find it very fair since they can funnel as many promises as they want to politicians through a lobbyist without necessarily being there.


## Key Facts & Figures

* 76% of Europeans believe corruption is widespread around the EU {% tooltip COM(2014) 38 of 3.2.2014, Report from the Commision to the Council and the European Parliament, 'EU Anti Corruption Report', Page 5, Retrieved from: <a href='http://ec.europa.eu/dgs/home-affairs/e-library/documents/policies/organized-crime-and-human-trafficking/corruption/docs/acr_2014_en.pdf'>http://ec.europa.eu/dgs/home-affairs/e-library/documents/policies/organized-crime-and-human-trafficking/corruption/docs/acr_2014_en.pdf</a>  %} according to recent Eurobarometer Survey. {% endtooltip %}

* Corruption costs the EU around €120 billion per year, around 1% of the EU’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP)

* {% tooltip EUR-Lex, ai0020 of 26.01.2016, 'Division of competences within the European Union', Retrieved from: <a href='http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv%3Aai0020'>http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv%3Aai0020</a>  %} The area of freedom, security and justice is of shared competence in the EU. {% endtooltip %} This means that both the EU and its member states may adopt legally binding acts in the area concerned. In other words either Member States adopt a legislation on which the EU has instructed them to, or if the EU has no legislation on the matter the Member State can legislate as it pleases.

* People are most likely to say they are personally affected by corruption in Spain, Greece (63% in each) and Cyprus (57%) all countries which have received financial aid by the EU.

## Measures In Place

* The European Commision publishes a report on Corruption every two years which includes both the progress regarding corruption and solutions to it.

* GRECO monitors corruption in its members through an {% tooltip Council of Europe Group of States against corruption (GRECO), 'How does GRECO work', Retrieved from: ttp://www.coe.int/t/dghl/monitoring/greco/general/4.%20How%20does%20GRECO%20work_en.asp  %} evaluation and compliance procedure in order to make members adopt new ways of combating corruption. {% endtooltip %}

* Transparency International publishes reports which review how corruption is dealt with in the EU and offers both criticism and advice.

* An Experience Sharing Programme was launched by the European Commission in 2015 in order to allow all stakeholders to share their experience and advice through workshops across Europe.

* {% tooltip  European Partners against corruption (EACN), 'EACN', Retrieved from: <a href='http://www.epac.at/about/eacn'>http://www.epac.at/about/eacn</a>  %} European contact-point network against corruption (EACN) {% endtooltip %} is a formal network comprising close to 50 anti-corruption authorities from European Union Member States. The network was set up to improve cooperation between authorities mandated with the prevention of and fight against corruption in the European Union.
