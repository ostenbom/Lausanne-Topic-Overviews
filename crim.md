  Illegal drug trade in the EU is estimated to be worth as high as 100 billion dollars. Following the adoption of the 2013-2020 EU Drugs Strategy, what additional measures should European Institutions take to help Member States in the fight against illegal drug markets run by organised crime groups?

## Explanation & Relevance of the Topic:

**Sizeable markets** for cannabis, heroin and amphetamines have existed in many European countries since the 1970s and 1980s. Over time, other substances also established themselves — including MDMA (Ecstasy) in the 1990s and cocaine in the 2000s. The market continues to **evolve**, with the last decade witnessing the emergence of a wide range of **new psychoactive substances**. The nature of the illicit drug market has also been changing as a result of **globalisation**, **technology** and **the internet**. Additional challenges are presented by **innovations in drug production and trafficking methods** and the establishment of {% tooltip  Source: <a href='http://www.emcdda.europa.eu/publications/edr/trends-developments/2015/online/chapter1'>http://www.emcdda.europa.eu/publications/edr/trends-developments/2015/online/chapter1</a>  %} new trafficking routes. {% endtooltip %} The EU governments face new problems with newly developed substances. First they have to be detected, then traced down the source, see what it is made of and what its effects are and how they are distrubuted and then they have to be integrated into the current drug policy. **Distribution** via the internet is becoming increasingly common, with 693 online shops detected in 2012. These alternate means of communication have made the {% tooltip  Source:European Drug Report 2013   <a href='http://www.talkingdrugs.org/european-drug-2013-facts-and-figures'>http://www.talkingdrugs.org/european-drug-2013-facts-and-figures</a>  %} drug market harder to control.  {% endtooltip %}

In a third of the European countries, a focus has been put on **harm reduction** rather than a war on drugs. People with addiction problems have the opportunity to receive **treatment** in rehabilitation facilities, which differ from state to state. Main actions are {% tooltip  What is substitution treatment: <a href='http://www.emcdda.europa.eu/attachements.cfm/att_37235_EN_sel00_1en.pdf'>http://www.emcdda.europa.eu/attachements.cfm/att_37235_EN_sel00_1en.pdf</a> %} substitution treatments {% endtooltip %}, **psychological care** and **reintegration** into society. Furthermore, there are so called {% tooltip  Medically supervised drug consumption rooms:

<a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhLoLbORzi0'>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhLoLbORzi0</a> %} medically supervised consumption rooms {% endtooltip %}, in which addicted people can use their drugs in a clean environment. They are provided with the necessary material (e.g. needles) and medical attention in case of overdose. This is a crucial measure to prevent the spread of diseases like HIV or Hepatitis B and C, and public drug scenes.

## Key Conflicts:

Addicts **criminalise** themselves constantly through the possession and usage of illegal substances. According to the law, they should clearly be prosecuted, however, according to the {% tooltip  WHO: World Health Organisation (as a tooltip) %} WHO {% endtooltip %} an addiction is defined as an {% tooltip  <a href='http://www.who.int/substance_abuse/terminology/definition1/en/'>http://www.who.int/substance_abuse/terminology/definition1/en/</a>  %} illness {% endtooltip %} and therefore has to be treated. These two very different approaches are commonly labelled as the {% tooltip  For further reading: <a href='http://www.drugpolicy.org/new-solutions-drug-policy/brief-history-drug-war'>http://www.drugpolicy.org/new-solutions-drug-policy/brief-history-drug-war</a>  %} **war on drugs** {% endtooltip %}, where everyone who deals, consumes or possesses drugs is punished or even incarcerated, and **harm reduction**, where addicts are instead treated to reduce the demand for drugs. The USA has waged a war on drugs since the 1970s and usually in Europe drug policies are a combination of the two. Please watch this video on the War on Drugs and harm reduction here:

One other conflict is, that every Member State(MS) has its own drug policies and are only mildly bound to follow the EU Drugs Strategy 2013-2020 and its **Action Plan** While MS are encouraged to comply with the strategy, it is not enforced. This gives EU institutions a limited range of action. Also **non-EU** countries are affected, since drug trafficking ignores EU borders.  

It has been argued by some that **decriminalisation** or even **legalisation** could solve many problems posed by illegal drug trade. **Portugal** adopted this approach and decriminalized the possession and consumption of all illicit drugs in 2011. Anyone in possession of drugs is no  longer arrested but instead sent to a dissuasion-commission, where a lawyer, a doctor and a social worker determine if and to what extent the person is addicted to drugs. They can then refer that person to a voluntary treatment program, fine them or impose other kinds of administrative sanctions. Trafficking offenses and dealing remain illegal and prosecuted by the legal system. Against a lot of predictions, Portugal has had {% tooltip  Source: <a href='https://www.drugpolicy.org/sites/default/files/DPA_Fact_Sheet_Portugal_Decriminalization_Feb2015.pdf'>https://www.drugpolicy.org/sites/default/files/DPA_Fact_Sheet_Portugal_Decriminalization_Feb2015.pdf</a>  %} decrease of drug use, fewer drug related deaths, a decline in HIV infection rates, fewer incarcerations and reduced social costs of drug misuse. {% endtooltip %}

## Facts & Figures:

* 1990 the first European plan was drafted to combat drugs

* 2000 the first EU Drug Strategy was implemented

* 2004 a EU Drug Strategy has been evaluated for the first time

* 2012 it has been evaluated **externally** for the first time (by the EMCDDA)

* This link gives you an impression on where and how many people use drugs in the EU: [http://www.emcdda.europa.eu/countries/prevalence-maps](http://www.emcdda.europa.eu/countries/prevalence-maps)

## Measures already in place:

The **Justice and Home Affairs Council of the European Union** endorsed an **EU Drugs Strategy** from 2013-2020 and it’s first **Action Plan** 2013-16). It includes 16 objectives and over 50 actions. It is crucial to have a look at the following measures, in order to understand what you can build on. Have a look {% tooltip  <a href='http://www.emcdda.europa.eu/attachements.cfm/att_215054_EN_ST12809.EN13.PDF'>http://www.emcdda.europa.eu/attachements.cfm/att_215054_EN_ST12809.EN13.PDF</a> Action Plan 2013-16 %} here {% endtooltip %} or {% tooltip  Concise summary of European Drug Report 2013:

**Summarised**, it:

* Enhances new law enforcement coordination and **cooperation** between MS,

* Gives special attention to new means of **communication** and **technologies**,

* Addresses the **reduction of health and social risks and harms** caused by drugs,

* Enhances the role of the **civil** **society**

* Aims for social **reintegration** and **recovery** of addicted people,

* Wants equivalent care in penal institutions as in health facilities,

* Stresses need for **empirical** and **evidence-based** approach to **drug** **policy**

* Supports drug **monitoring** and **collection** of data on **best** **practices**.

## Key actors:

The **European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction** (EMCDDA) was set up to provide factual, objective, reliable and comparable information concerning drugs, drug addiction and their consequences. They organise a lot of activities like conferences, events of all kinds and prevention in schools.

**Reitox** is a European information network on drugs and drug addiction, consisting of a representative from each MS their gathered information on national level build the basis for the monitoring and evaluation of the EU strategy;  meet twice a year; co-financed by MS and EMCDDA

The **Justice and Home Affairs Council** (JHA) is made up of justice and home affairs ministers from all the EU member states. In general, justice ministers deal with judicial cooperation in both civil and criminal law and fundamental rights, while home affairs ministers are responsible for migration, border management and police cooperation, among other matters. However, not all EU member states have the same division of tasks between ministers. The JHA Council is {% tooltip  Source: <a href='http://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/council-eu/configurations/jha/'>http://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/council-eu/configurations/jha/</a>  %} also responsible for civil protection. {% endtooltip %}
