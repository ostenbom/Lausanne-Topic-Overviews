  Free movement or annual quotas? Following the results from the Swiss electorate to place restrictions on the free entry of EU workers, what should the stance of the EU be towards Member States and associated states with restrictive immigration policies towards EU citizens?

## Explanation of the Problem & Relevance of the Topic

Even though Switzerland is not a Member State of the EU, the **bilateral agreements** between the two have created strong ties to be acknowledged. One of these agreements concerns the {% tooltip  Explanation of Free Movement of Persons in the EU:
 <a href='https://www.opensocietyfoundations.org/explainers/what-eu-freedom-movement' >https://www.opensocietyfoundations.org/explainers/what-eu-freedom-movement</a> %} free movement of persons {% endtooltip %}: Switzerland has signed the {% tooltip  Free Movement Agreement between the EU and Switzerland: <a href='http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:22002A0430(01):EN:HTML' >http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:22002A0430(01):EN:HTML</a> %}  **Agreement on Free Movement of Persons** (AFMP) {% endtooltip %} in 1999, and it came into force in 2002. This agreement confers upon the citizens of Switzerland and of the Member States the right to freely choose their place of employment and residence within their mutual territories.

However, in a referendum of January 2014, the Swiss electorate voted for {% tooltip  Bloomberg Article on the Referendum:
<a href='http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-06-20/swiss-propose-quota-system-for-eu-immigrants-after-referendum' >http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-06-20/swiss-propose-quota-system-for-eu-immigrants-after-referendum</a>
A Swiss Newspaper Article on the results of the Referendum:
<a href='http://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/quotas-and-questions_swiss-agree-to-curb-immigration-and-rethink-eu-deal/37877780' >http://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/quotas-and-questions_swiss-agree-to-curb-immigration-and-rethink-eu-deal/37877780</a> %} the initiative "Against mass immigration". {% endtooltip %} Part of this initiative entailed altering the existent AFMP. **Annual quotas** on EU migrants were proposed with this initiative. Although, the initiative has not been implemented yet, the EU has reacted strongly against any possible restrictions on free movement of persons. As free movement of persons is one of the four {% tooltip  4 Fundamental Freedoms: Free Movement of Goods, Free Movement for Workers, Right of Establishment and Freedom to Provide Services, Free Movement of Capital  %} fundamental freedoms {% endtooltip %} protected by the EU treaties, the EU has been reluctant to accept any measures that would restrict it.

Similarly, as the United Kingdom has recently proposed to make changes in its migration policy on EU migrants, how can the EU balance keeping good relationships with these states and being true to its fundamental principles? What should EU’s stance towards Switzerland be if Switzerland puts into force the proposed changes to its immigration policy?

## Key Conflicts

The major problem concerning restrictions on free movement of persons is the effect it would have on the {% tooltip  Paper on the Referendum and the Proposed Changes: <a href='https://www.ceps.eu/system/files/PB331%20EU-Swiss%20Mobility%20.pdf' >https://www.ceps.eu/system/files/PB331%20EU-Swiss%20Mobility%20.pdf</a> %} agreements between Switzerland and the EU. {% endtooltip %} The AFMP contains a "**guillotine mechanism**" which means that if it’s terminated, {% tooltip  Presentation on EU-Switzerland Bilateral Agreements <a href='https://www.eda.admin.ch/dam/dea/en/documents/folien/Folien-Abkommen_en.pdf' >https://www.eda.admin.ch/dam/dea/en/documents/folien/Folien-Abkommen_en.pdf</a>
 %} all other EU-Switzerland agreements {% endtooltip %} (such as the Dublin/Schengen, free trade, custom facilitation and security agreements) would also be automatically terminated.

The result of setting restrictions on EU migrants in Switzerland will reciprocally mean that Swiss national would be viewed as **third country nationals** and they would not enjoy any privileges in the EU anymore. The amount of skilled worker migrants influx has significantly contributed to Swiss economy and as EU Member States are Switzerland’s greatest trading partners, the restrictions will influence this relationship negatively.

Within the EU framework, the Treaties safeguard {% tooltip  The EU’s existent policy on free movement is expressed for workers in Regulation 492/2011 and art 45 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) , and for citizens in Art 18 and 20 TFEU and the Citizenship Directive (2004/38/EC)) %} free movement of persons. {% endtooltip %} Protecting the free movement of persons is a priority for the EU, as not only Switzerland but also Member States - {% tooltip  Article on Free Movement and the UK:

## Measures In Place

After the "**Against mass immigration**" referendum in 2014, the first order of business of the Swiss government has been the amendment of the Swiss federal constitution. Article 121a has been put in place which aims at Switzerland autonomously regulating its immigration policy. It entails {% tooltip  Swiss Policy on Europe presentation on EU-CH relations with a special focus on the amendments on free movement of persons

Seeking a mutually acceptable agreement, the idea of a **safeguard clause** has been introduced. Such a clause would set a maximum immigration limit, so that if passed, restrictions could be implemented. In the meantime, the {% tooltip  Foreign National Act (FNA):

 %} Foreign National Act {% endtooltip %} was decreed in January 2015, which transpositioned Article 121a into national law.

## Key terms and Key Actors

**Agreement on Free Movement of Persons (AFMP)**

It is one of the many of agreements between the EU and Switzerland. It aims to provide easier entry, residence and access to the labor market for EU nationals in Switzerland, and vice versa.

**Referendum on "Against Mass Immigration"**

This referendum was held in January 2014 where the Swiss electorate decided by a majority vote of 50.3% that there should be more restrictive measures taken on EU migrants. Some of the restrictive measures involved annual quotas on EU migrants and privileging resident workers for available jobs.

**Free movement of persons**

It is one of the four fundamental freedoms of the EU, safeguarded by the EU Treaties. It grants EU nationals the right to move freely between Member States in order to reside, find employment or establish businesses.

**EU nationals**

EU nationals have the right of free movement within the EU and various states associated thereto by agreements.The main two provisions of the {% tooltip  Summary of the Switzerland-EU Agreement
<a href='http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=URISERV%3Aem0025' >http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=URISERV%3Aem0025</a> %} agreement between Switzerland and the EU {% endtooltip %} entail free movement of persons and protection against discrimination based on nationality. Thus what the referendum proposes, privileging Swiss residents over EU migrant workers for jobs, constitutes discrimination on the grounds of nationality and infringes EU nationals’ rights.  

**Swiss nationals**

In October 2015, the Swiss People’s Party (SVP) has won the biggest share of votes in parliamentary elections. SVP won with the best result that any party had in at least a century in Switzerland, which indicates that they have mass support from the public. The party strongly supports the restrictions on the basis that EU migrants cause rising rents, crowded public transport and higher crime rates. The rising amount of asylum seekers in EU is also worrying for the public and this directs them to{% tooltip Swiss vote turns into plebiscite on EU immigration Article <a href='https://www.euractiv.com/section/justice-home-affairs/news/swiss-vote-turns-into-plebiscite-on-eu-immigration/' >https://www.euractiv.com/section/justice-home-affairs/news/swiss-vote-turns-into-plebiscite-on-eu-immigration/</a> %} support the immigration restrictions. {% endtooltip %}

**European Commission**

{% tooltip  European Commission’s Statement to the Parliament <a href='http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_STATEMENT-14-32_en.htm' >http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_STATEMENT-14-32_en.htm</a> %} European Commission firmly requests the Swiss government to find a way not to implement the proposed restrictions {% endtooltip %} and sees the agreements as a whole package which Switzerland can not choose to divide and implement as it would want.

Following the referendum, European Commission took responsive action. It terminated the negotiations of energy deal which would harmonize EU-Switzerland electricity market. It also proceeded to exclude Switzerland from the {% tooltip  Switzerland and the EU: The Heavy Costs of Isolation Article <a href='http://www.huffingtonpost.com/student-reporter/switzerland-and-the-eu-th_b_5003363.html' >http://www.huffingtonpost.com/student-reporter/switzerland-and-the-eu-th_b_5003363.html</a> %} Erasmus+ (education) and Horizon 2020 (research and innovation) programmes. {% endtooltip %}
